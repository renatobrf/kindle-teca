# My Reading Collection

This collection was born out of my interest in understanding the world from different perspectives — from the history of major technology companies to the fundamentals of business and finance that shape our society.

Along the way, I realized that reading was not only a way to gather information but also an opportunity for **self-knowledge.** Many of these books helped me improve my decision-making, deal more effectively with daily pressure, and broaden the way I approach both personal and professional challenges.

At a certain point, my goal was no longer just to discover new titles but also to engage in the exercise of **compiling and organizing** everything I had already read. This curation became a way to consolidate ideas, revisit lessons, and create a reference base that continues to guide me to this day.

Even so, the habit of seeking out new books has never stopped. The collection keeps growing — not only in volume but also in meaning, like a constantly evolving map of my intellectual and personal journey.

**My sincere thanks for taking the time to explore this project and for seeking reading references based on my personal experience.**

## Scribbles and Notes

My reading method is dedicated and consistent — usually one chapter per day, every day of the week. I always keep a highlighter at hand to mark the points that catch my attention, and for each book I open a new text document for notes, organized according to the same chapter structure used by the author.

Over time, **e-Books** emerged as an evolution in this search for content, bringing significant savings in acquiring new titles as well as the immediate availability of their content.
